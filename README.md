# Getting Started
ðŸ›  An useful project structure for creating effectively Python applications

# Usage
1. Clone repository git clone https://github.com/htq287/q-python-template.git
2. `cd` into `q-python-template`
3. To create a virtual environment, go to your projectâ€™s directory and run the following command. This will create a new virtual environment in a local folder named `.venv`:   
`python3 -m venv .venv`
4. Activate a virtual environment
  
    `source .venv/bin/activate`
  
    To confirm the virtual environment is activated, check the location of your Python interpreter:

    To deactivate a virtual environment

    `deactivate`
5. Install packages
